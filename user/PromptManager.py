            Our client, Distero, is a large grocery distributor based out of the US. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Distero identified that its customers, US grocery stores, have had significantly increased grocery deliveries to end consumers. Distero is bringing in our team to investigate whether they can, and should, offer direct to consumer (DTC) e-commerce grocery delivery. How would you advise our client?

            Candidate should identify that they need to both reach a market size in terms of consumers and dollars. The final answer does not matter as long as it follows a logical thought pattern in reaching the answer.
            A sample market sizing is as follows:
            • Total size of US is ~300M
            - Average household size is 4
            - Number of total households in US is 75M
            - Household monthly grocery bill $500
            - Annualized grocery bill (500*12) = $6,000
            - Total grocery market (75M*6k) = $450B
            - 33% estimated use of e-comm for groceries (450*.33 and 75M*.33) = $150B and 25M households
            - 10% likely market penetration (150B*.1 and 25M*.1) = $15B and 2.5M households
            Candidate should conclude that this is a significant potential market for Distero but should push for potential risks associated with this move including customer / supplier reaction, capabilities, and set up costs.
